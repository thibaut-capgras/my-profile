		<h2>Music</h2>
		<p> Before you continue scrolling, you must know your classics. I love hip-hop music. West Coast music is a subgenre of hip hop originating from California. I paticulary love it for its laid-back, funky beats and smooth, melodic flows. Influential artists include Dr. Dre, Tupac, Snoop Dogg, and Kendrick Lamar. The West Coast sound has had a major impact on the genre as a whole, shaping its development for decades. You can find my playlist right there:</p>

		<h2>Travel</h2>
		<p> I absolutely adore traveling, and there's nothing quite like exploring new cultures and traditions. I'm particularly fond of Northern America and all its amazing cities and landmarks. By the way, I'm thrilled to be heading to Los Angeles soon. I'm also eager to discover the rich cultures of Asia. From the bustling streets of Tokyo to the chill temples of Bali, there's so much to explore and experience. I can't wait to see where my travels will take me next! </p>

		<h2>Sports</h2>
		<p> I am absolutely stoked about mountain sports! Whether it's scaling a towering peak or shredding down a steep slope on my skis, I can't get enough of the adrenaline rush that comes with extreme sports. But it's not just the mountains that get my blood pumping. I've been eyeing up some sick skateboarding and BMX spots, too. There's something surrounding those sports that just speaks to me. </p>
